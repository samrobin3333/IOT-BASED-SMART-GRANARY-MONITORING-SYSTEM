# IOT-BASED-SMART-GRANARY-MONITORING-SYSTEM
The smart granary system allows farmers and storage managers to monitor temperature and gas levels in real-time. It helps prevent spoilage by sending alerts when levels exceed safe limits. This system ensures efficient grain storage management, making farming practices more effective and reliable. This system was implemented using Raspberry Pi.
